2 different methods of listing numbers and their squared values. One which prints the number and it's square on each iteration, the other adding the numbers to a list which is then printed at the end. In both cases, if the resulting square number is greater than 200, the loop ends and the numbers/list is printed. A initial number is entered and the squared values of the numbers from 1 to the given number are given.
